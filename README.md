# Project: Embedding Images and Video [HTML/CSS]

## Description

This project was done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s [HTML/CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css). The goal of the project is to produce a not-so-exact replica of the YouTube video player page, embedding video and images where necessary. The purpose is to strengthen some of the skills learnt during the original foundation course.
